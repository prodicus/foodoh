oca Grande is a lounge pad. A place to meet,

    

greet and most definitely eat. A brick and mortar
version of a social networking site. Where a guest can
choose friends. build relationships, engage in fun activities, voice an opinion, be
entertained and completely unwind. It is a place that serves complete respite from

cranky bosses and impossible spouses.

A place that doles out free, unlimited laughter and squeals of joy with every serving of
coffee, tea, or shrimp grilled with soy. A place that will soon be called a second home,
Or maybe even a first. A place where opinions ought to be voiced with the same ease
as our Chef whipping up a portion of Crepes Suzette. A place that is aptly called —
Boca Grande, Spanish for ‘The Big Mouth’. A place that for the tun seeking, walking

talking refined palette, is an absolute first.
